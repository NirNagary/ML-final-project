Motivation & Goals:
With more than 10,000 companies available for investment solely in the USA, how should a young investor decide which company to invest in? This dilemma often leads them towards the more familiar and prominent names in the industry, such as TSLA, SPY, APPL, etc. 

We aim to categorize companies based on their financial stability into ideally four to five groups, from the strongest to the weakest. Our goal is to guide young investors towards discovering new investment opportunities that hold significant potential for positive returns.


We employed a variety of clustering algorithms to understand their differences and select the optimal one. As discussed in our lecture, the standard approach involves experimenting with multiple algorithms and making a choice based on personal preference. 
The algorithms we implemented, as learned in class, include DBSCAN, K-Means, the EM algorithm, and Hierarchical clustering.
Each algorithm was executed on datasets that were subjected to PCA for both 2 and 3 components, as well as on the original dataset without any PCA application.
